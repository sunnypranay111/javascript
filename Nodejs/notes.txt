            can be used to set up a new or existing npm package.

npm init --yes :: Generate a package without having it ask any questions.

npm install "package name":: This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

npm install "package name" --save-dev :: Most of the time, you have some packages that are needed only for

                devDependencies object in your package. json file.

npm install -g packagename :: it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a
                                 global package.
